# OS Visual Studio 
(Ongoing Project) OS Visual Studio is a JavaScript-based simulator that helps in visualising all major Operating Systems algorithms in undergrad OS course.
## Simulations Done

  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Job First (SRTF)
  - Round Robin
  - Priority (Preemptive)

- Disk Scheduling

  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
  - SCAN
  - C-SCAN
  - LOOK
  - C-LOOK

- Page Replacement

  - First In First Out (FIFO)
  - Least Recently Used (LRU)
  - Optimal Page Replacement

- Deadlock Avoidance

  - Banker's Algorithm

- Memory Allocation Techniques

  - First Fit
  - Best Fit
  - Worst Fit
