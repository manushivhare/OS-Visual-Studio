## About
Operating Systems being such an important subject for computer professionals, there arises a need wherein an application can help visualise all the popular algorithms of Operating systems. Our purpose by developing this application is:
1. To provide a user friendly interface to simulate and visualise all the major algorithms of operating systems with utmost efficiency.
2. To encourage students to have an in-depth understanding of the algorithms via charts, graphs, and calculation tables.
3. To provide a common discussion platform to the community of students, teachers, and tech professionals to discuss, post, and answer queries related to the OS algorithms

## Functionality & Concepts
- The different variants and all parameters of the algorithms have been considered.
- The fully-responsive website, created via materialize-css and bootstrap, has a very simple and interactive interface that uses material UI features in different activities involving the simulations and calculations.
- The backend has been created using PHP and MySQL, that aids in downloading individual progress results and allows users to participate in the discussion forum.
#### Simulation of the following algorithms can be done via OS Visual Studio:
- CPU Scheduling

  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Job First (SRTF)
  - Round Robin
  - Priority (Preemptive)

- Disk Scheduling

  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
  - SCAN
  - C-SCAN
  - LOOK
  - C-LOOK

- Page Replacement

  - First In First Out (FIFO)
  - Least Recently Used (LRU)
  - Optimal Page Replacement

- Deadlock Avoidance

  - Banker's Algorithm

- Memory Allocation Techniques

  - First Fit
  - Best Fit
  - Worst Fit
